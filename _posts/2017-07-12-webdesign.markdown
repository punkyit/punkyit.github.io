I used to spend hours and hours working on websites as a teenager. I wasn't very good at it, but I enjoyed finding new code, plugging them in, tweaking them, and seeing what happened.

I also played around a lot with a photo editing program I had at the time and discovered the joys of graphic design. I'd make my own graphics, match the CSS with the colors and styles of my graphics, and boom... pretty website/MySpace/Neopets page/whatever.

I didn't even know what I was doing was a "thing." Had I known that, my career would've taken a vastly different path (*aaand* I'd probably be making more money...) I was interested in web design when I was at an impressionable age where developing educational and career goals were expected of me. Web Design didn't even *occur* to me as an option, which is very unfortunate and I regret it sometimes.

Fast-forward to today, and I'm honestly overwhelmed by all the developments that have been made with the web. All the different coding languages, the tools available, the new web standards, APIs, etc. Like I see all these projects on GitHub and check out how these brilliant minds collaborate, and I just feel hopelessly in the dust.

I'm hoping to use this website as a way to catch up a little. I was passionate about web design in the past, so why not try to rekindle that passion? There's so much to learn. And while it's a bit discouraging to be so far behind, I have to start somewhere!
