I used to work in a library and hoarded books that looked interesting to me (no joke, it was rare that I *didn't* have my library card maxed out.) Most of these books I didn't even read, but [Show Your Work!](https://medium.com/show-your-work/10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered-7fb5fdfbc068) by Austin Kleon deviated greatly from that category.

My key takeaway from devouring that book within a couple hours was the second chapter: **Think Process, Not Product**. I didn't realize how much I had been focusing on an end product, without considering what needed to happen behind the scenes to bring it into fruition. This explained a lot about my tendency to become easily disheartened when my projects were not turning out the way I had envisioned.

Fast forward to recently, and I'm at a point where I'm not terribly ashamed to share my process. It's messy and less glorious, but essential. So I've decided I'm going to showcase it.

This isn't a portfolio. It's more like a scrapbook. To get super meta about it, this website itself is part of the scrapbook.
