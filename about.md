My name is Diedra. This website is my scrapbook of projects (most of which are technology-oriented.)

I don't have a formal education in technology, but I do enjoy learning. Most of my experience is in end user support. I have humble beginnings: for years I worked in a busy public library in the hometown of a major university. There, I was at the frontline of supporting everyday users during the dawn of mobile devices. This is what opened my eyes to the benefits of technology, and how it can be used to enhance our daily lives.

Since that time, I've developed an interest in the design and functionality of the technology we use. I see it as a beneficial and powerful tool that, when utilized effectively, has endless potential to provide positive benefits to us. This intrigues me greatly and inspires me to learn, so that I may undestand and contribute.
